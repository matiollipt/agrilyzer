# Agrilizer: The Digital Fertilizer of Data and Insight

**Agrilizer** is a modular agrometeorological intelligence system. The library provides a Python client for retrieving and visualizing NASA POWER daily weather data together with agrimetric parameters. The agrimetric parameters can be used in machine learning and data analysis alone, or be combined with weather data for a more comprehensive understanding. PyTorch Frame powers the multimodal models for crop yield prediction. It also features a configurable visualization with built-in themes, allowing clear visualization of weather and agrimetric data.


The data from the POWER API can be used for various agricultural purposes, such as:

* Crop Production and Land Use: Understanding land surface reflectance, land temperature, and vegetation greenness.
* Weather Impact on Crops: Tracking rainfall, droughts, and severe weather events to assess growing conditions and threats.
* Water Management: Calculating evaporation patterns and water runoff.

## Features

* üì° Fetch daily weather data directly from the NASA POWER API
* üìä Plot and overlay time series of weather and agrimetric data
* üîç Filter by date ranges and custom value thresholds
* üß† Built-in parameter descriptions for interpretability
* üó∫Ô∏è Interactive location mapping
* üé® Configurable visualization themes

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agrilizer.git
cd agrilizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Modify `config.json` to adjust:

* Default weather parameters
* Colormaps and plot style
* NASA POWER base API URL

### Usage

```python
from agrilizer.analyzers import Agrilizer
from agrilizer.visualization import Visualizer
from agrilizer.config import cfg

client = Agrilizer("MySite", lat=-10.5, lon=-55.3, start="2023-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
df = client.get(long_names=True)

viz = Visualizer("MySite", cfg["POWER_PARAM_DESCRIPTIONS"], client.get)
viz.plot(cols=["T2M", "PRECTOTCORR"], ma=7, dual=True)
```

## Example Output

* üìà Time-series plots with moving averages
* üå¶ Overlay plots for crop and weather data
* üîÅ Monthly aggregation with correlation analysis
